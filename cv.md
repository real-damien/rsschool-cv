### Briefly About Myself:

A year ago, I decided to try myself in programming. I completed the piscine at School 21 and enrolled in the main program. I haven't made a final decision on a specific direction yet, but it seems like frontend development will be the closest to me. My main profession is related to cinematography; I work as a camera operator.
